<h1>Rose curves</h1>

<p>What are rose curves like? Like putting a pen at the end of a wheel and spinning it to draw a circle. 
However, a wheel has a fixed distance between the center spoke and the wheel's edge but for a rose 
curve we change the diameter in an oscillating way.

<p>For the following images, the roses are defined as 

\[
x = \cos(k \theta) \cos(n \theta) \\
y = \cos(k \theta) \sin(n \theta)
\]

where n is the speed at which we move around in a circle and k controls how the
radius changes as a function of \( \theta \).

<p>The rose equation is a variation on a circle. If I wanted to draw a circle, I would use the following
equation
\[
x = r \cos(\theta) \\
y = r \sin(\theta)
\]

where r is the radius. 

<p>Because these curves are based on oscillating terms, they produce lovely circular patterns (repetitive patterns). 
Below are the results of various experiments made with processing.

<h3>Rendering style #1: Diagonal draw</h3>
<hr>

<p>This style is based on drawing tight lines across a diagonal. The position along the line is determined by our 
rose equation. 

<p>Here is the result of a lines with a fixed length. By rendering the lines with a lighter grey and multiplying them 
against the current canvas color, we can bring out the details when the curves double backs on itself.

<p>Here is another look using ADD and a dark background

<h2>Varying line lengths</h2>

<p>Perlin noise implements noise which varies smoothly based on the input. So if I call noise with two points near each 
other the generated noise values will also be close. Basically, perlin noise is prettier than uniform noise. 

<p>Below are results where we vary the line lengths based on Perlin noise.

<h2>Varying the equation #1</h2>

<p>Below we change the equation like so

<h2>Varying between two equations</h2>

<h2>Varying the color</h2>

<h2>Animating between curves</h2>
